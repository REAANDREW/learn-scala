# String Calculator

Just a small project to get myself used to a few things:

- scala
- sbt
- functional programming

I have given quite a lot of focus to making use of pattern matching.

## Requirements

See requirements.txt

## Compiling and Testing

> sbt test

## Continuous Testing

Go into sbt

> sbt

Then run a clean and a test

> ~~ ;clean;test
